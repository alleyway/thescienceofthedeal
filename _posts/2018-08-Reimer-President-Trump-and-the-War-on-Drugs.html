<p>On March 18th, President Trump delivered a speech in Manchester, New Hampshire concerning the opioid crisis and drug trafficking. Many Americans were startled by his statements, whereby he called for drug dealers to “face the death penalty as part of his plan to combat the US painkiller-addiction epidemic.” He said that, despite stiff political and judicial oppositions, his administration intends to change the law to execute drug dealers, a move that mimics actions taken by China, Singapore, and the Philippines. He was cheered by the Manchester crowd upon stating that “if we don’t get tough on the drug dealers we’re wasting our time,” and that that “toughness includes the death penalty.” Though certainly a more severe approach, these words reflect the position he took on the growing opioid problem during his campaign. In October 2016, he suggested that to stop the flow of opioids into the United States, “we should apply the resources necessary to mitigate the problem,” and that “we can do that and we will in the Trump administration.” Nevertheless, Trump has not always taken such a rigid position in regard to the War on Drugs. In a luncheon held by the Miami Herald in 1990, he referred to the nation’s drug enforcement effort as “a joke,” and insisted that the legalization of all drugs, and in turn the collection of tax revenue for an education campaign on their dangers, would be the only way to win the War on Drugs. Some argue that his most recent statements are unprecedentedly controversial, but a glance over the decades old debate on the War on Drugs reveals some perspectives equally as stringent. </p>

<h4>Richard Nixon</h4>

<p>The War on Drugs was coined by President Nixon when, at a press conference in June of 1971, he declared drug abuse “public enemy number one,” and that to defeat this ‘enemy,’ “it is necessary to wage out a new, all-out offensive.” In light of the War on Drugs initiative, the Nixon administration dramatically increased the size and presence of drug control agencies, creating both the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention (SAODAP) and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). Many of Nixon’s reforms remained in place into the mid-1970s when the War on Drugs underwent a slight hiatus. The Reagan administration revived.</p>

<p></p>

<h4>Ronald Reagan</h4>

<p>Upon the beginning of his term, President Reagan intensified many of Nixon’s War on Drugs policies. In 1984, his wife, Nancy Reagan, initiated the heavily-publicized anti-drug “Just Say No” campaign to educate children on the dangers of drug use. This led to a dramatic increase of incarceration rates - the number of people behind bars for nonviolent drug law offenses rose from 50,000 in 1980 to over 400,000 by 1997. This refocus on drugs set the stage for the zero-tolerance policies of the late-1980s, wherein 1986, Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act - a policy that set mandatory minimum prison sentences for specific drug offenses. It was criticized for racist ramifications because it allocated harsher prison sentences for offenses involving equal amounts of crack cocaine (more often used by black Americans) as powder cocaine (used more often by white Americans). Such drastic reforms during Reagan’s tenure remained into the next and continued to expand incarceration rates. </p>

<h4>George H.W. Bush</h4>

<p>Throughout his eight-year tenure as vice president, George H. W. Bush led the Reagan administration’s task force on fighting the War on Drugs. Upon succeeding Reagan as President in 1989, in his first televised national address, Bush declared drugs “the greatest domestic threat facing our nation today.” He expanded this narrative when, under the 1033 program (then known as the 1208 program), he militarized domestic drug law enforcement.</p>

<p></p>

<h4>Bill Clinton</h4>

<p>Despite advocating for treatment rather than incarceration during his presidential campaign, President Clinton’s approach to the War on Drugs was comparable to those of his Republican predecessors. Primarily, he rejected a U.S. Sentencing Commission recommendation to end the discrepancy between crack and powder cocaine sentences. In September of 1994, Clinton signed the Omnibus Crime Bill into law, expanding the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death - such as operation of large-scale drug enterprises, an approach uncannily similar to that which Trump recently advocated. During Clinton’s campaign for re-election, he boasted, “my 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins,” a statement reflective of increased incarceration rates and, subsequently, prison overcrowding. </p>

<h4>George W. Bush</h4>

<p>Upon the start of George W. Bush’s tenure, the War on Drugs had stalled, yet he advocated aggressive anti-drug policies reminiscent of Reagan-era campaigns. Bush allocated huge proportions of budget proposals to anti-drug efforts, including a push for $23 million for drug-testing in schools. Moreover, he advocated aggressive drug treatment and enforcement, insisting that the federal government must increase border security as it “has a critical responsibility to enforce our nation’s drug laws and to stop international drug traffickers,” that “the Southwest border is the front line.”</p>

<h4>Barack Obama</h4>

<p>President Obama exercised a more progressive approach to the War on Drugs as compared to his predecessors. Under the Obama administration, the government opted to treat drugs as an issue of public health rather than one of criminal justice. He advocated ex-offender support (such as job training, substance abuse and mental health counseling) programs so such individuals could successfully reintegrate into society, as well as the elimination of sentencing disparities (specifically the discrepancy in sentencing crack and powder-based cocaine). Obama criticized the harsh penalties for drug dealing, noting in 2001 that selling 15 Ecstacy tablets was the same class of felony as raping a woman at knifepoint. Moreover, he was the first president in decades to conclude his tenure with a smaller federal prison population than that which he inherited - an achievement attributable in part to his efforts to undo harsh sentencing against nonviolent drug-offenders. Nonetheless, despite the strides undertaken to decriminalize drugs and reduce the incarceration rates, the effects were minimal - largely due to the abandonment of said efforts following the Republican-wave midterm elections of his first term. Additionally, although Obama attempted to ease the War on Drugs overall, drug-related immigrant deportations rose by 43% by the end of 2012. Of Obama’s most significant policy decisions pertaining to drug abuse was the emphasis on treatment and prevention spending, which are also the most at risk today.</p>
