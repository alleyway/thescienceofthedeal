            <h4>Overview of Method</h4>
            <p>Like so many others, we found ourselves surprised by President Trump’s victory. We had consumed many of the polls that signaled a clear and easy victory for Hillary Clinton. Why did we get this so wrong? This question initiated our early discussions that led to experimenting with several methods of analysis, including varieties of semantic analysis (e.g. sentiment and content analysis).</p>

            <p>After several months of reading, listening, and watching President Trump’s speeches, we found that performative discourse analysis to be the most powerful. In contrast to semantic analysis, performative analysis focuses on the way a speaker uses language as opposed to the meaning of the specific terms the speaker uses. At the Initiative on Religion, Politics and Conflict we had been using performative analyses in diagnosing religious groups’ language behavior. This project is effort to apply our expertise in religious discourse to President Trump.</p>

            <p>In the research and analysis on this site, we focus on how Trump speaks to his supporters, the country and the world at large. UVA undergraduate students have manually scored over 100 of President Trump’s speeches. To score the speeches, the students would count the number of instances of nine discourse categories (see below), and weight them for each given speech as a percentage of the total word count. This project specifically recruit undergraduates from different political, educational, religious, and ethnic backgrounds to avoid bias in scoring.</p>

            <p><b>Our categories are:</b></p>
            <ol type="1" style="font-size:18px">
            <li><b>Qualitative Hyperbole:</b> Excessive use of exaggerated superlatives (e.g., very, great, the best!)</li>
            <li><b>Quantitative Hyperbole:</b> Use of absurdly large numbers (e.g., "billions and billions and billions...") </li>
            <li><b>Egocentrism:</b> Constant reference to himself and self-aggrandizement (e.g., "I alone can fix it.") </li>
            <li><b>Repetition:</b> Repeated references to person, thing or event (excluding himself) </li>
            <li><b>Opportunism:</b> Taking advantage of popular fears and misconceptions (e.g., "They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.") </li>
            <li><b>Compliment:</b> Over-the-top flattery (e.g., "You're a very special man," Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping.) </li>
            <li><b>Binary:</b> Us-vs-them rhetoric</li>
            <li><b>Implicature:</b> Use of conventional language to insinuate something to group insiders (e.g., "dog whistling" and sarcasm) </li>
            <li><b>Counter-factual:</b> Counterfactual statements intended to imply conspiracy (e.g., "They could be ISIS. It could be a plot.") </li>
            </ol>
